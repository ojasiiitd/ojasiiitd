# Hi there!

I've completed my Bachelor's at IIIT-Delhi, Computer Science and Social Sciences Dept, Majoring in Computer Science with Economics and Sociology as Minor subjects. Post bachelors, I worked in Oracle as a Member of Technical Staff for 3 years.

I beleieve laguage soaks a lot of history and culture: subtle changes in a language can help us trace events in the past and patterns of the future. Hence, I'm currently a working as a Research Scientist at IIT-Delhi, exploring the expansive field of Computational Linguistics gorunded in the Indian Language context, to learn how linguistic phenomena have and continue to inform these boundaries.

I'm also obsessively interested in Ancient History, reading Fiction and going for long sweat-inducing runs.
