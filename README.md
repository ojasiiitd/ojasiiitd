# Hi there!

I've completed my Bachelor's at IIIT-Delhi, Computer Science and Social Sciences Dept, Majoring in Computer Science with Economics and Sociology as Minor subjects. I've been working in Oracle as a Member of Technical Staff since. I've worked on implementing, stress testing and analysing performance for various Oracle 23AI features on very large databases.


I beleieve laguage soaks a lot of history and culture: subtle changes in a language can help us trace events in the past and patterns of the future. Hence, I'm currently exploring the expansive field of Computational Linguistics to learn how linguistic phenomena have and continue to inform these boundaries.

I'm also interested in Ancient History, I enjoy reading Fiction and enjoy going runs.
